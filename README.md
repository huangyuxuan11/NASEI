# Neural Architecture Search-Based Specific Emitter Identification Method
##A brief introduction to this code:
###1.Lora_dataset_generation: the acquired raw IQ Lora signal is converted into spectrogram form as a dataset for the experiment.
###2.train_search: search for the optimal convolutional architecture based on gradient descent algorithm.
###3.train_lora: fine-tune the network parameters to obtain the final model.
